V1.0
- First public release
- Platform specific versions contain precompiled tools
- Source versions require Qt Creator 3.3.0 or higher to build the tools

V1.1
- Now Vortex supports changing handedness. To do that, you can do this at the
  beginning of your program:

    Import vortex.src.handedness
    #VORTEX_HANDEDNESS=Mode

    Where mode can be one of:
    VORTEX_LH: Left handed coordinate system (the default now)
    VORTEX_RH_Y: Right handed coordinate system, with Y as up vector
    VORTEX_RH_Z: Right handed coordinate system, with Z as up vector
                 (the default in previous versions of Vortex)

    Left handed system uses clockwise order for rotations and triangle winding,
    and maps textures from the top left to the bottom right.
    Right handed systems use counter clockwise order for rotations and triangle
    winding, and maps textures from the bottom left to the top right.
- Added procedural API. Despite differences in implementation on the Object
  Oriented layer, the procedural API should offer the same functions as a
  future implementation of Vortex in C++
- Added Vortex_GetAPIVersion and Vortex_GetShadingVersion
- Support for JSON meshes and fonts replaced by XML versions
- Meshtool replaced by Irrlicht-based version
- Fonttool and meshtool are now build from a .bat file (requires TDM-GCC-32
  on Windows)
- Removed animation sequences from the engine. Now animations are a simple
  linear of keyframes, and you decide the first and last frame for the
  animation. This helps keeping Vortex a bit simpler, and it is not hard to add
  sequence support on a higher level engine
- Several bug fixes
