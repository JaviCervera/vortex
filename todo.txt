Possible roadmap (not guaranteed to be implemented in this order):

V1.1
- Possibility to switch the vertical axis of screen coordinates for 2D (and maybe make downwards default?)

V1.2
- Add vertex animation
- Add skinned animation

V1.3
- Add realtime stencil shadows
- Add OpenGL ES 1 renderer, for better compatibility with older machines

V2.0
- Add shader based soft shadows
- Improve meshtool
- Add multitexturing, with cube, normal, specular, light & detail maps (maybe more)
- Add render batching
